# Learning to Search
These jupyter notebooks + slides are inspired by the lectures from https://duvenaud.github.io/learning-to-search/. 

This will be organized into several "sessions" around a concept we will work up to. 

Sessions:

- Multi-armed bandits, Contextual bandits, and Tree Search
- Modern methods in SAT Solvers and TSP-style problems
- Modern methods in Evolutionary Algorithms and Non-gradient Optimization
- Current research on Learning to Program


Other resources will be listed within the slides of the session folders.
